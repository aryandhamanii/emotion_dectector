"This project implements a multi-modal approach to affective computing by synthesizing deep learning-based facial expression analysis with physiological computer vision. By leveraging the DeepFace framework alongside custom HSV color-space analysis, the system calculates a dynamic stress index that accounts for both micro-expressions and facial flushing—a common physiological indicator of autonomic nervous system arousal. To ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience, the application utilizes a temporal smoothing buffer, tracking emotional trends over time to identify persistent mental health indicators rather than transient shifts."
